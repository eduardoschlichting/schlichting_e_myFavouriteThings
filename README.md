# My Favourite Things - Web App :computer:

## Hello There! Good to have you here! ðŸ‘‹

This is a HTML, CSS and JavaScript based project done as a practice to use AJAX and fetch calls to retrieve data from a data file, or a database.

The Web App highlights some of my favourite hobbies, such as desigining stuff, reading stuff, and gaming a little bit!

Have fun getting to know a bit more about me, bud :D
